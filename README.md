# chess_GUI

A chess GUI made with Flutter to interact with my chess engine.

# Features

Currently working features:
- Player versus player mode (PVP).
- Player versus Bot mode (PVE).

W.I.P:
- Save and load ongoing match.
- Theme customization.
- Background music.
- Redo move (in PVE only).

# Future Plan

Extend PVP mode, allow LAN connection to play.
Bot levels selection.
